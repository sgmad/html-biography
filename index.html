        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Early life and education</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            My story doesn't start with me. It starts with my parents, and what brought them together.
        </p>
            <img src="images/picop.jpg" alt="[A photo PICOP]" width="150" align="left">
            <p> 
                In 1963, a paper-mill company named Paper Industries Corporation of the Philippines (PICOP) established itself 
                in Bislig City, Surigao Del Sur. This sparked a massive economic boom in the area, attracting workers from various 
                regions, including my parents and their parents at the time. They met as teachers in a local school established by 
                PICOP, and from their union came my older sister. Some time later, I was born.
                <br>
                I come from a town where almost everyone is a descendant of the workers of this now defunct company, and the thought 
                that none of us would have been here today had this one single company not picked this town is something 
                I often reflect on.

        <p>
            It hadn't taken long for my parents to realize raising two children on a teacher's salary would be difficult <small>(They realized
            this in the early 2000s, imagine how much worse things are now)</small>. My father, ever the opportunist, decided to abandon his 
            career as an educator and decided to pursue a career in law enforcement. A move so succesful, that it had influenced my early
            childhood wants and dreams growing up.
        </p>
        <p>
            I grew up quickly. Being the only son of a policeman had its drawbacks. Beyond that, I also had a strict and stern mother.
            I didn't quite get what people meant when they insinuated that the "bunso" is treated well, as I had the total opposite experience
            growing up. Of course, I was only the "bunso" for about 12 years before a younger sister came along.
        </p>
        <p>
            I attended the same school where both my parents first met in, all throughout elementary and high school. It became a Catholic private 
            school by the time me and my siblings attended. As a grade schooler I was boisterous and fun like I am now, but by the time high
            school came around I was reserved and quiet. I'd sit in my chair and let the day pass by. This was around the same time my
            mother got promoted to school principal, so I guess that kinda added to me seeming intense and intimidating to my peers.
            It didn't matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did of course discover that the position meant I could be absent as much as I wanted without any repercussions, so long as I kept my grades up.

        <h3>Late teens and present day</h3>
        <img src="images/msu-iit.jpg" alt="[Photo of me 400 kms away from home, in a totally foreign environment]" width="400">
        <p>
            <small>Picture taken: Some time 2023</small>
        </p>
        <p>
            After high school, I was offered the opportunity to move to Iligan City to attend Mindanao State University - Iligan Institute of Technology's Integrated Developmental School,
            which is just the fancy name for their Senior High School department. I accepted the offer, and moved to Iligan City, about 400 kilometers away from home.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the earlier bio made it seem like I didn't have any friends growing up, I actually had a lot. They all later went to Davao City for college, while I chose to go to Iligan
            to ensure that my Senior High School slot would translate to a higher priority in college application at MSU-IIT. It was a tough decision, but one I don't regret. I learned a
            lot about myself and life during my time there. It also was ultimately all for nothing, as MSU-IIT is quite possibly the toughest state university to get into in Mindanao.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were only 40 slots each for the half-dozen computing-related courses they offered, and I was competing with thousands of other applicants from all over the Philippines. I didn't get in.
            In a way I was relieved, I quite didn't like the place. It sucked. So I went back home, and followed my friends to Davao, where my lazy ass decided to enroll in the University of
            Mindanao. I enrolled in the summer. MSU-IIT's senior high school ends early to actually prime their own students for the MSU-IIT entrance exams. So I had a lot of time to spare.
            I was officially enrolled as a First Year, in the summer term. Best decision of my life.
